Will 2023 be the comeback year for IPOs? What will it take for the public market to thaw? Here are the Crunchbase News staff's top picks for the companies we think could go public next year.

And if some of these sound familiar, it's because they are: In our 2022 edition of this list, we predicted many of these might go public this year. Little did we know that the IPO markets would stall. So here we are again, offering up some thoughts on who might make public debuts, if and when IPOs start happening again. Enterprise tech and cybersecurity. Arctic Wolf: It wasn't that long ago when Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Arctic Wolf seemed IPO bound. The company raised $150 million in a Series F in July 2021, taking its valuation from $1.3 billion to $4.3 billion. At that time, then-CEO Brian NeSmith said an IPO was likely the next logical move. Then the market changed drastically, and in October the managed security provider raised $401 million in convertible notes led by existing investor Owl Rock. Convertible notes work like a short-term loan, but these notes are repaid to the investor at a later point in equity — i.e. after an IPO — typically at a discount. The managed security space can support large players and Arctic Wolf has grown large since being founded in 2012. Perhaps those notes turn to equity in 2023. Databricks: Everyone has been on Databricks for a while. As recently as February, CEO Ali Ghodsi talked about going public, but offered no timeline. The market has only grown colder for IPOs since then, but this is a company that ended 2021 with more than $800 million in annual recurring revenue.

Everlaw: In November, Oakland, California-based Everlaw closed a $202 million Series D led by TPG at a valuation of more than $2 billion. While that may not turn many heads during these salad days in the VC market, Everlaw is a legaltech company—a sector that is seeing heightened interest as the cloud and COVID-19 have caused more legal processes and documents to ... The company signaled it at least had an IPO on its mind in October, when it announced the hire of a new CFO with a track record at pre-IPO and public companies. MasterClass: Generally, a consumer-facing company doesn't raise $461 million in venture funding with a plan to simply stay private indefinitely. So, it wouldn't be a big surprise to see San Francisco-headquartered MasterClass dipping a toe in the public markets in coming months. The online education platform offers courses on a ... The six-year-old company raised a $650 million Series E earlier this year, but developing deep tech for space is not cheap. Maybe its next fundraising will be in the public market with all the increasing interest SPACs have shown? — Marlize van Romburgh and Chris Metinko. Illustration: Dom Guzman · Learn More.
